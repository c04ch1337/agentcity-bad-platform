# Mercenaries Addâ€‘On (Safe & Fictional)

Drop the **`mercenaries/`** folder into your `ai-battle-legion/` repo root, then apply the backend and frontend patches in `backend_patch/` and `frontend_patch/`.

- Each mercenary has `*.md` (profile) and `*.json` (prompt template).
- Backend loads JSONs at startup and exposes `/mercenaries` endpoints.
- Frontend adds a simple "Mercenaries" panel to list and instantiate.

> Fictional, defensive-only. No exploit code, no step-by-step attacks.
